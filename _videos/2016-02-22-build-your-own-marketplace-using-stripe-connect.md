I promise by the end of this session you’ll be able to build your own Ebay, taking payments from customers and settling them to your clients all while taking a slice off the top of that sweet cherry pie for yourself.

In this talk I demonstrate how to use Stripe Connect, a product that drastically simplifies taking payments from customers and settling directly to your clients.

You’ll learn about:

- The big players in online payments in Australia
- Some key concepts about taking money online
- Step by step how to use Stripe Connect with your ASP.NET MVC application
