I promise by the end of this session you’ll be able to build your own Ebay, taking payments from customers and settling them to your clients all while taking a slice off the top of that sweet cherry pie for yourself. In this talk I demonstrate how to use Stripe Checkout and Stripe Connect, two products that drastically simplify taking payments from customers and settling directly to your clients.
You’ll learn about: – The big players in online payments worldwide- Some key concepts about taking money online- Why marketplaces are a great opportunity for developers- How to easily add a credit card form to your website – Step by step how to use Stripe Connect with your ASP.NET MVC application to take payments on behalf of your clients.
